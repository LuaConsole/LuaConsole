# RRP2InventoryChecker: made by card, for people on da trello card :100: :weary: :weary:

### PUBLIC VERSION RELEASED WHITELIST IS FOR USERS THAT ARE PART OF THE STAFF TEAM OR ARE IN GAME MODS/ADMINS/HEADADMINS ON RRP ETC. 

only works on synapse and krnl, may work on some that have consoleprint/write but will probably only work on synapse and krnl for the foreseeable future, may make one completely based off of prefix instead of having to use an external window, that would be cool

this github is only used for that purpose :)

also refer to https://github.com/LuaConsole/RRP2InventoryChecker/blob/main/hello.md pls k bye
